API stands for
Application programming interface

a simple API called
worldtimeapi.


It gives the time of any specified
location on the planet.
http://worldtimeapi.org/api/timezone/Asia/Bharuch


There is a lot of information such as
week_number, offset, timezone, etc.
There is something called ‘datetime’
which tells us the date and the time
with very high precision.

This is called JSON data structure.
JSON stands for Javascript Object
Notation


A JSON structure can hold multiple
values inside { }. Each value is
indexed by a name.

For example, here the date and time
value is indexed by the name
"currentDateTime"


We can call an API using fetch().
fetch() sends a request to the API
service and collects the response.

call this API using fetch and
collect the response in a variable.

Javascript executes this
synchronously. It means that it
executes one line after the other. It
will not wait for the ‘fetch API call’ to
be completed before moving to the
next line

We do this
by adding await before fetch(). It tells
the computer to wait for the API call to
be completed before moving to the
next lines.


asynchronous function - a function
which waits for some lines to be
completed before jumping to the next
line.
